  <p align="center">
    The Advising Student System is a comprehensive solution developed as part of the Database Course at the German University in Cairo. The project aimed to create a dynamic system for managing student advising interactions, utilizing MySQL for database management and ASP.Net for web application development. Divided into three milestones, each phase contributed to the overall success of the system.

## About The Project

The Advising Student System project was divided into three milestones to systematically develop and implement the system.

### Milestone 1: ER Diagram and Relational Schema
This milestone focused on designing the database structure using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and defining the relational schema. The team collaborated to create a comprehensive visual representation of the data model, outlining entities, relationships, and attributes. This phase laid the foundation for the subsequent milestones.

### Milestone 2: Database Implementation
The second milestone involved implementing the MySQL database for the Advising Student System. The team adhered to specific guidelines, defining appropriate data types, following naming conventions, and ensuring proper data retrieval. Key functionalities were implemented using stored procedures and views.

### Milestone 3: Web Application Development
This final milestone focused on building the web application using ASP.Net. The Student, Advisor and Admin Components were developed, each with its specific functionalities.
