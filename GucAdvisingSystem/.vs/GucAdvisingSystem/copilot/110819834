Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **CSS Specificity**: There might be another CSS rule that is more specific than your rule and is therefore overriding it. For example, if there\u0027s an inline style or a rule with an ID selector, it will take precedence over a class or element selector.\n\n2. **CSS Inheritance**: The \u0060text-decoration\u0060 property is not inherited, but the effects of it are. This means that if you set \u0060text-decoration: underline;\u0060 on a parent element, it will appear on all child elements, even if you set \u0060text-decoration: none;\u0060 on the child.\n\n3. **Pseudo-classes**: If you\u0027re trying to remove the underline from a link, you need to make sure you\u0027re targeting the correct pseudo-classes. Links have four states: \u0060:link\u0060, \u0060:visited\u0060, \u0060:hover\u0060, and \u0060:active\u0060. To remove the underline from all states, you would need to include all of them in your CSS rule.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of how you might do this:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060css\na, a:visited, a:hover, a:active {\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis will remove the underline from links in all states.\n\n4. **Browser Default Styles**: Some browsers have default styles that might be overriding your CSS. You can try to reset these styles using a CSS reset stylesheet.\n\n5. **Incorrect Syntax or Typo**: Ensure that your CSS rule is written correctly and there are no typos.\n\nRemember, always ensure your CSS file is properly linked to your HTML file and that the browser is not caching an old version of your CSS file.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["What is CSS Specificity?","How does CSS inheritance work?","What are pseudo-classes in CSS?","How can I reset browser default styles?","How can I prevent browser caching issues?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}
